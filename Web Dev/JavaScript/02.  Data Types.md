Mainly There are 3 types of data types:-

### Number:-

`let a = 34`

`a` is declared as a **number data type**. Any type of number can store in this data type

  

### String:-

`let firstName = "Anish"`

This is **String** data type

  

### Boolean:-

`let isLoggedin = true`

Or `let isLoggedin = false`

This is a **Boolean** data type

  

There are also 2 other Data Types:-

 - `null`  this means nothing

  

- `undefined` this also means nothing

  

Both are not same.
